## Getting Started
In order to setup and work on this project on your own, you will need to:

Clone this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/hoangquochung1110/odin-restaurant.git
```

Once you have cloned this project, you can install the required dependencies by using:
```
npm install
```

Distribution files can be produced using:
```
npm run build
```

Deploy to GH Pages
Our output html file is in `dist` folder while GH pages is looking for an index.html in the root directory of the project. So there's more work to do to host your completed page.
According to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490)
```
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

## Improvements
* Responsive Design
* Stateful Single Page App
